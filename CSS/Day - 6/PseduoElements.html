<!-- Pseudo Elements-->

<!-- 
    =>   A keyword added to a selector that lets you style  a specific part
        selected elements(s)    

        (for pseudo elements we use double colon :: )
       
       Eg: -> :: first-letter   (abc  - to change a we use this)
              :: first-line      ( first line of the paragraph)
              :: selection
