    <!-- ENTITIES -->
    <!-- 
        => an html entity is a piece of text("string") that begin with an ampersand(&) and ends with a semicolon(;).
        => used to display  reseved characters (which woudl otherwise 
           be interpredted as HTML code), and invisible characters (like non breaking spaces).
        => can also use in place of characters that are difficutl to type with a standard keyboard.
        => browser interprets them & renders correct characters

        eg :  &nbsp; -> non braking space
             &lt; ->  less than symbol 
            &gt;-> greater than symbol

            coomonly used ; &amp; -> &
                            &lt; -> <
                            &gt; -> >
                            &quot; ->  

        => we can print using character codes
